  "t.kuks": {
    "p": "The banks of life and death - the remains of the former Baroque baths and the majestic Hospitál, separated by the Elbe, the mythical river Styx. This is Kuks in a nutshell, the work of Count František Antonín Špork and the best artists of the time, led by Matthias Bernard Braun.",
    "p2": "Kuks can be reached either by bicycle or on foot via the trail in front of the house. The bike route takes 6 minutes and is 1.5 km long. Make sure to stop at St. Clement's Quarry along the way."

    "h1": "Les Království reservoir",
    "p": "It looks like a castle, but the reality is far more prosaic. The Les Království Dam is built in a pseudo-Gothic style and it is probably the most beautiful dam on our territory. It's 13 km by bike from Stanovice and you're there in less than an hour."

  "t.josefov": {
    "h1": "Josefov Fortress",
    "p": "The Baroque fortress was built against the Prussian invasion, but unfortunately it did not prevent them. In fact, it never even fought back. The Prussians simply bypassed it. Well, too bad for them. You definitely don't make the same mistake and let yourself be guided through the underground passages or take a beautiful walk on the top of the fortification."
